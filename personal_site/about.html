                <h4>Learner</h4>
                <p>Zdravo! Ja sam Adin, I am new to learning how to code. A lot of the inspiration came from bouncing in and out of many different kind of software programs but never wanting to dip my toes in computer science. I love to build computers its lot of little complicated things that make a whole wonderful thing work together, I like to call it adult legos.</p>
                <p>Some things that I also enjoy to spend my time on:
                    <ul style="font-size: 15px; gap: 15px;">
                        <li>Experimenting with newly found things like in music, coding, or cooking(trying to learn at least)</li>
                        <li>Big passion with video games, I play a very large variety of games and love experiencing the art that people can make with games.</li>
                        <li>Really big on the outdoors, I could be outside doing absolutely nothing and enjoy every bit of it. Although I usually can't stay away from music so thats always around.</li>
                        <li>Speaking of music, anyone got any new artists and gems that deem worthy of a listen, by all means send it my way. I love finding new artists from all over the world and seeing them growing</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Besides many other things that change in life like schooling choices, job experiences, how one looks. Those few things above have never changed and I am glad I can look back and enjoy that it hasn't</p>
                <h1>also also I love international anything so recommendations on things like food and music from other parts of the world I will gladly try, that's coming from a Bosnian born in Germany that has lived in the US mainly :)</h1>
